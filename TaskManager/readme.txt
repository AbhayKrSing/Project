Project Idea: Task Manager

Description: Create a task manager application that allows users to manage their tasks and stay organized. Users can add tasks, set due dates, mark tasks as completed, and categorize them into different lists or categories.

Features:

Task Creation: Allow users to create tasks by providing a title, description, due date, and category.

Task Listing: Display the list of tasks with their relevant details, such as title, due date, and completion status.

Task Filtering and Sorting: Implement options to filter tasks based on categories or completion status. Also, provide sorting functionality to arrange tasks by due date or priority.

Task Editing: Enable users to edit task details, including title, description, due date, and category.

Task Deletion: Allow users to delete tasks that are no longer needed.

Task Completion: Implement a feature to mark tasks as completed, visually distinguishing them from ongoing tasks.

Task Reminders: Provide optional reminders for approaching or overdue tasks, such as notifications or email alerts.

User Authentication: Implement user authentication functionality to allow users to create accounts, log in, and securely manage their tasks.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the application is responsive and optimized for various screen sizes, including desktop and mobile devices.

Data Persistence: Use local storage or integrate with a backend service (such as Firebase or a custom REST API) to persist the tasks and user data.

By building a Task Manager application, you can practice various React concepts such as component composition, state management, form handling, routing, and integrating with backend services. Additionally, you can enhance the application with additional features, such as task prioritization, task sharing among users, or adding attachments to tasks.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this idea based on your interests and learning goals. Happy coding!
